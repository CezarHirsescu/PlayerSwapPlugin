## Editing/Compiling it manually:
#### Dependencies: 
You will need the Java SDK version 1.8 

You will also need to download a craftbukkit library from their website: https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit

#### Compile: 
If you want to edit my code and compile it yourself, you probably know how to do so. Make sure to compile everything in the src folder. If certain files are missing, such as
the plugin.yml file, the plugin may not work. 


## Using the plugin on your bukkit server:
All bukkit servers come with a "plugins" folder. Once you have your .jar file, just copy and paste it into the "plugins" folder, then reset your server.
